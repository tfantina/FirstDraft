     <strong>FirstDraft</strong> is a distraction free writer designed to help you
     get your thoughts unto the page as quickly and easily as possible.
     </p>
     <p>
     A major problem that many people have is the tendency to mix the creation and
     editing processes.  <strong>FirstDraft</strong> attempts to seperate the two
     by removing the temptation to go back and constantly revise your work when your
     working on your first draft.  It also removes spelling and grammar correction
     until you enter review mode.  
</p>
<p>
     There is no reason to go back and keep revising what your writing just relax,
     take a deep breat and start writing.
