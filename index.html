     <p>
       FirstDraft is designed to minimize distractions; and not only distractions <em>around</em> the page but distractions <strong>on</strong>the page. Specifically what you've already written.
     </p>
     Kurt Vonnegut once said:
     <p>
       <blockquote>
         "Swoopers write a story quickly, higgledy-piggledy, crinkum-crankum, any which way. Then they go over it again painstakingly, fixing everything that is just plain awful or doesn’t work.”
       </blockquote>     </p>
     <p>
       If this is your style of writing, you not interested in what you've already written at least not in the first draft ✍️ your top priority is getting your thoughts on to the page, you can go back and edit later.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>To similar effect Ernest Hemingway has been quoted as saying:
     <blockquote>
       "Write drunk edit sober"
     </blockquote>
     <p>
       If your having trouble starting, or you find yourself paralized by what you've already written, ie. the tendency to edit every single senteance before you finish your draft.  FirstDraft is designed for you.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>FirstDraft blurs your previous lines forcing you to focus on the current line and that line alone
     📝.
